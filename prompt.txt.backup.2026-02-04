=== ODDS SWEET SPOT (PREFERRED FOCUS) ===

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Find WINNERS - odds between 3.0 and 9.0 (2/1 to 8/1) are IDEAL**

This is your CORE FOCUS, but use judgment. Quality of opportunity matters more than strict ranges.

Historical performance data shows this range is MOST PROFITABLE:
• 3.0-9.0 odds (2/1 to 8/1): 28.6% win rate, 54% ROI - SWEET SPOT ✓
• Under 3.0 odds: Generally poor value, but strong favorites (2.5-2.9) with exceptional form can work
• Over 9.0 odds: Generally inconsistent, but value picks at 10-12 with strong case are acceptable

**IDEAL WINNER PROFILE:**
- Odds: 3.0 to 9.0 (decimal) / 2/1 to 8/1 (fractional) - PREFERRED range
- Recent WINNER in last 3 races (crucial!)
- Solid course/distance experience
- Currently in-form trainer
- Racing at optimal class level (not over/under-matched)
- Good jockey booking

**Why 3.0-9.0 is the TARGET:**
- High enough odds for strong returns (3.0 = 200% profit on stake)
- Realistic win probability (not outsiders or no-hopers)
- Horses with genuine winning form, not just placing
- Optimal risk/reward balance proven by our data

**CONFIDENCE BOOSTING:**
- 3.5-6.0 range (ultimate sweet spot): ADD 25 points to base confidence
- 3.0-9.0 range (sweet spot): ADD 15 points to base confidence
- Outside range but strong case: Standard confidence calculation

**GUIDELINES for picks outside 3.0-9.0:**
- 2.5-2.9 odds: Consider if exceptional recent form + class advantage + favorable conditions
- 9.0-12.0 odds: Consider if recent winner (last 2 races) + clear form advantage + value edge
- 12.0-15.0 odds: Only if compelling value story + recent win + all factors align
- Over 15.0 odds: Generally avoid - but exceptional cases with strong reasoning are possible

**Daily Selection Approach:**
1. PRIORITIZE: Horses with odds 3.0-9.0 that have WON in last 3 races
2. EVALUATE: Strong candidates slightly outside range (2.5-2.9 or 9.0-12.0) with compelling cases
3. SELECT: Best overall value opportunities - aim for 70%+ of picks in 3.0-9.0 range, but quality over quotas

The sweet spot is where WINNERS live most consistently. Focus there, but don't ignore exceptional opportunities just outside the range.

=== SELECTION CRITERIA ===

**PRIORITY Factors (in order):**

1. **VALUE EDGE (CRITICAL - HARD RULE)** - Market efficiency check
   - **NEVER BET IF edge_percentage < 0%** = AUTOMATIC REJECTION
   - Negative edge means market knows something we don't
   - Positive edge required: Shows genuine value opportunity
   - Best picks have edge_percentage > 20%

2. **VALUE & FORM** - Best combination of value + recent winning form
   - Odds 3.0-9.0 with recent win = IDEAL target
   - Odds 2.5-2.9 or 9.0-12.0 with exceptional form = Consider
   - Focus on WINNERS, not just placers

3. **CLASS CONTEXT (CRITICAL NEW RULE)** - Wins must be in relevant class
   - **Recent win in SAME class** > multiple wins in lower class
   - **Class step-up risk:** If last wins were in lower class, reduce confidence by 30%
   - **Class drop opportunity:** Won at higher class before, increase confidence by 20%
   - **ALWAYS verify class level of last 3 wins** - context matters more than count
   - Form from 2 classes below = largely irrelevant

4. **COURSE FORM (MAJOR EDGE)** - Proven winners at this specific track
   - **Course winner (1+ wins here):** +25 confidence points (proven edge)
   - Course placed (2-3 finishes): +12 points
   - Never raced here: Neutral (not negative, but needs strong form)
   - **Course winners repeat at ~25% higher rate** than first-timers
   - Course form > generic form in close calls

5. **RECENT WINNER** - Must have WON (not just placed) in last 3-5 races
   - Win in last race **in same/higher class**: +30 confidence points
   - Win in last 2-3 races **in same/higher class**: +20 confidence points
   - Multiple wins in last 5 **in same/higher class**: +40 confidence points
   - **Wins in lower class:** Half points (e.g., +15 instead of +30)

6. **GOING MATCH PRECISION (NEW WEIGHTING)** - Track conditions matter
   - **"Perfect" going match:** +15 confidence points (rare, valuable edge)
   - "Good" going match: +5 confidence points (common)
   - "Unknown" going match: -10 confidence points (hidden risk)
   - Perfect conditions can make 15-20% performance difference

7. **TREND CONTEXT (REFINED)** - Improving vs Hot Streak
   - **IMPROVING in same class** > HOT STREAK from lower class
   - Example: 3-2-1 (improving, same class) beats 1-1-1 (hot, lower class)
   - Improving shows horse adapting to competition level
   - Hot streak from easier races = class-step-up risk

8. **IN-FORM STATUS** - Current winning form, not past glory
   - Recent win within 30 days: EXCELLENT
   - Recent win within 60 days: GOOD
   - Last win over 90 days ago: CONCERNING (needs other strong factors)

9. **TRAINER/JOCKEY IN-FORM** - Current winners, not historical stats
   - Trainer has winners this week: +10 points
   - Top jockey booking: +8 points

10. **COMBINED SCORE THRESHOLD (NEW HARD RULE)** - Minimum quality bar
    - Calculate: value_score + form_score + class_score (out of 30)
    - **Minimum 20/30 required** to qualify as pick
    - Below 20/30 = reject regardless of individual high scores
    - Ensures picks are well-rounded, not one-dimensional

**WINNING FORMULA (UPDATED):**
Positive Edge + Same/Higher Class Win + Course Form + Sweet Spot Odds (3.0-9.0) = HIGH PROBABILITY SELECTION

**MANDATORY REJECTION CRITERIA (DO NOT BET IF ANY TRUE):**
1. edge_percentage < 0% → REJECT (market smarter than analysis)
2. confidence < 30% → REJECT (too uncertain to bet)
3. combined_score < 20/30 → REJECT (not well-rounded enough)
4. Last 3 wins all in classes 2+ levels below current → REJECT (class step-up too big)

**CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES (UPDATED):**
- Confidence < 30%: **DON'T BET AT ALL** (not even EW)
- Confidence 30-50%: EW only (protection needed)
- Confidence 50-70%: Win + EW (solid pick)
- Confidence 70%+: Win bet priority (high conviction)

Output Format:
runner_name,selection_id,market_id,market_name,venue,start_time_dublin,p_win,p_place,ew_places,ew_fraction,tags,why_now

Focus 80%+ of selections on horses that meet NEW criteria 1-5 above (positive edge, class context, course form). These refinements eliminate systematic errors.

=== CRITICAL LEARNING: Musselburgh 13:55 Loss (2026-02-01) ===

**MISTAKE IDENTIFIED:** Over-weighted course experience, under-weighted VALUE SCORE

Race: Musselburgh 13:55, 5 runners, Good to Soft
✗ Selected: Koukeo (2.2 odds) - LOST
✓ Missed: Pure Carbon (3.25 odds) - WON

**Why We Made the Wrong Choice:**
- Koukeo: Value Score 7/10, Edge 14.4%, Form 9/10, 1 course win
- Pure Carbon: Value Score 9/10, Edge 23.5%, Form 8/10, 0 course wins

We chose the horse with course experience over the horse with SUPERIOR VALUE.

**NEW MANDATORY RULES - EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **VALUE SCORE IS PRIMARY (40% weight)**
   - When comparing horses with similar form (8-9/10), ALWAYS prefer higher value score
   - A 9/10 value horse beats a 7/10 value horse even with course disadvantage
   - Edge percentage difference >8% = value horse MUST be favored

2. **PROGRESSIVE FORM > PERFECT RECENT FORM (30% weight)**
   - Form pattern U-2-1 (improving trajectory) can be STRONGER than 1-1-X (plateau)
   - Look for IMPROVEMENT trend, not just recent wins
   - A horse getting better is more valuable than one maintaining

3. **SMALL FIELD VALUE DYNAMICS (≤5 runners)**
   - Favorites in 5-runner races are often over-bet
   - Give EXTRA weight to value picks at 3-5 odds with value score 8+
   - Course experience is LESS important in small fields

4. **COURSE WINS - HELPFUL NOT DECISIVE (Reduce to 15% weight)**
   - Course wins should NOT override:
     * Superior value score (9 vs 7)
     * Superior edge percentage (>15% difference)
     * Progressive recent form (U-2-1 vs 1-1-X)
   - Good horses adapt to new courses - don't penalize too heavily

**UPDATED DECISION WEIGHTING:**
- Value Score + Edge %: 40% (was 30%)
- Form Score + Trend: 30% (unchanged)
- Class/Course Factors: 30% (was 40%)

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
When multiple horses score 8+ on form, the tiebreaker MUST be value score, not course experience.
