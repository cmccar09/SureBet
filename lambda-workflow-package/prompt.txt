=== LEARNED INSIGHTS (Updated 2026-01-29) ===

Based on analysis of last 7 days performance (weekly learning cycle):

• AVOID favorite selections - losing 89% ROI (n=90)
• FOCUS on longshot selections - strong 87% ROI (n=38)
• AVOID mid_price selections - losing 95% ROI (n=183)
• AVOID outsider selections - losing 88% ROI (n=72)
• WIN bet strike rate too low (7%) - need stronger fancies (n=60)
• Each-way place rate too low (6%) - tighten EW criteria (n=97)
• Be cautious at: Wolverhampton, Lingfield, Kempton
• Winning pattern: prioritize enhanced_analysis selections

Apply these learnings when making selections. Continuously adapt strategy based on what works.
