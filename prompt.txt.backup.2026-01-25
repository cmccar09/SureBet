=== LEARNED INSIGHTS (Updated 2026-01-24) ===

Based on analysis of last 7 days performance (weekly learning cycle):

• AVOID favorite selections - losing 89% ROI (n=78)
• FOCUS on longshot selections - strong 238% ROI (n=21)
• AVOID mid_price selections - losing 95% ROI (n=169)
• AVOID outsider selections - losing 86% ROI (n=63)
• WIN bet strike rate too low (8%) - need stronger fancies (n=38)
• Each-way place rate too low (9%) - tighten EW criteria (n=67)
• Be cautious at: Lingfield, Kempton, Newcastle
• Winning pattern: prioritize enhanced_analysis selections

Apply these learnings when making selections. Continuously adapt strategy based on what works.
