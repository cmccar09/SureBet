=== LEARNED INSIGHTS (Updated 2026-01-19) ===

Based on analysis of last 7 days performance (weekly learning cycle):

• AVOID favorite selections - losing 96% ROI (n=90)
• AVOID mid_price selections - losing 96% ROI (n=154)
• AVOID outsider selections - losing 100% ROI (n=57)
• WIN bet strike rate too low (0%) - need stronger fancies (n=27)
• Each-way place rate too low (6%) - tighten EW criteria (n=62)
• Be cautious at: Wolverhampton, Lingfield, Newcastle
• Winning pattern: prioritize enhanced_analysis selections

Apply these learnings when making selections. Continuously adapt strategy based on what works.

Performance-Based Adjustments (Updated: 2026-01-19)
============================================================

1. HIGH_PRIORITY: Calibration error is 29.3%. Consider adjusting probability model or isotonic regression parameters.

2. MEDIUM_PRIORITY: Win rate 20.0% is significantly below expected 49.3%. Consider tightening overlay threshold or increasing min_back price filter.
