## 🎯 CONSERVATIVE SCORING SYSTEM - LOCKED

### Score Adjustment
**All raw scores reduced by 25 points** for realistic probability assessment.

### Threshold Configuration
```python
# In complete_daily_analysis.py (LINE 72-73)
raw_score = analyze_horse_comprehensive(...)
score = max(0, raw_score - 25)  # Conservative adjustment

# Thresholds (LINE 78-96)
show_in_ui = (score >= 60)  # UI promotion threshold

if score >= 60:
    confidence_grade = "EXCELLENT (Best Chance - 50-70% Win Rate)"
elif score >= 45:
    confidence_grade = "GOOD (Decent Chance - 30-40% Win Rate)"
elif score >= 30:
    confidence_grade = "FAIR (Risky - 15-25% Win Rate)"
else:
    confidence_grade = "POOR (Very Unlikely - 5-10% Win Rate)"
```

### Win Rate Expectations
| Grade | Score Range | Win Rate | Action |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| EXCELLENT | 60-100 | 50-70% | Bet with confidence |
| GOOD | 45-59 | 30-40% | Consider carefully |
| FAIR | 30-44 | 15-25% | High risk |
| POOR | 0-29 | 5-10% | Don't bet |

## 🔄 LEARNING WORKFLOW - LOCKED

### 4-Step Cycle (Every 30 Minutes, 11am-7pm)

```
STEP 1: Comprehensive Analysis
└─→ Runs: complete_daily_analysis.py
    ├─→ Analyzes all horses with 7-factor scoring
    ├─→ Applies -25 conservative adjustment
    ├─→ Promotes 60+ to UI (show_in_ui=True)
    └─→ Saves all to SureBetBets table

STEP 2: Match Results
└─→ Runs: match_racingpost_to_betfair.py
    ├─→ Queries RacingPostRaces for new results
    ├─→ Matches with SureBetBets predictions
    └─→ Updates outcome field (WON/LOST)

STEP 3: Learn from Outcomes
└─→ Runs: auto_adjust_weights.py
    ├─→ Analyzes which horses won vs lost
    ├─→ Calculates factor accuracy
    ├─→ Adjusts weights in weights_config.json
    └─→ Tomorrow's analysis uses new weights

STEP 4: Promote High Confidence
└─→ Re-scores learning data with new weights
    ├─→ Finds horses now scoring 60+
    └─→ Updates show_in_ui=True for newly qualified picks
```

## 📋 DAILY CHECKLIST - LOCKED ROUTINE

### Morning (10:00 AM - Manual)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\charl\OneDrive\futuregenAI\Betting

# Activate virtual environment (if not automatic)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 1. Fetch races
python betfair_odds_fetcher.py

# 2. Analyze all horses
python complete_daily_analysis.py

# Expected output: "3 HIGH-CONFIDENCE PICKS ready to bet on"
# Expected: "332 horses saved for learning"

# 3. View picks
python show_todays_ui_picks.py

# Verify: 100% coverage on all picks
# Verify: Grades show realistic win rates (50-70%, 30-40%, etc.)

# 4. Check database
python verify_all_horses_in_database.py

# Verify: 300+ horses total
# Verify: 30+ races covered
```

### Throughout Day (Automatic - No Action Required)
```
12:00 PM - Scraper captures first results
12:30 PM - Learning workflow matches results
1:00 PM  - Weights adjusted if results found
...continues every 30 minutes until 8:00 PM
```

### Evening (9:00 PM - Verification)
```powershell
# Check scraper ran successfully
Get-Content scraper_log.txt -Tail 50

# Should see: "Saved result for race: [course] [time]" multiple times

# Check picks with outcomes
python show_todays_ui_picks.py

# Should see: outcome="WON" or outcome="LOST" next to picks

# Check weights were updated
Get-ItemProperty weights_config.json | Select-Object LastWriteTime

# Should be today's date if results were found and learning occurred
```

### Weekly Review
```powershell
# Calculate win rate for EXCELLENT picks over last 7 days
# Target: 50-70% wins
# If below 40%: Consider raising threshold to 65+
# If above 80%: Consider lowering threshold to 55+
```

---

## 🔧 MAINTENANCE - LOCKED PROCEDURES

### If Scheduled Tasks Stop Running

```powershell
# Check task status
Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object {$_.TaskName -like "*Racing*" -or $_.TaskName -like "*Learning*"}

# Manually run scraper
python scheduled_racingpost_scraper.py

# Manually run learning workflow
python coordinated_learning_workflow.py

# Recreate tasks
.\setup_master_schedule.ps1
```

### If Analysis Produces 0 Picks

```powershell
# Check top scores
python show_top_picks.py

# If top scores are 55-59: Threshold too strict, lower to 55+
# If top scores are 30-40: System very conservative, working as designed
# If top scores are 0-10: Something wrong, check betfair_odds_fetcher.py
```

### If Database Needs Reset

```powershell
# Clear today's data
python clear_todays_bets.py

# Re-run analysis
python complete_daily_analysis.py

# Verify
python verify_all_horses_in_database.py
```

## 🎓 SYSTEM PRINCIPLES - LOCKED PHILOSOPHY

### 1. Conservative is Good
- Few picks (0-5/day) better than many picks (20+/day)
- Quality over quantity
- 60+ threshold ensures realistic confidence

### 2. Complete Learning Required
- ALL horses analyzed (not just favorites)
- 100% race coverage mandatory
- Winners teach us, losers teach us

### 3. Honest Probability Assessment
- -25 point adjustment = realistic expectations
- "EXCELLENT" = 50-70% win rate (NOT guaranteed)
- Clear win rate labels prevent overconfidence

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Every race result updates the system
- Weights adjusted daily based on actual winners
- Tomorrow's picks better than today's

### 5. Automation Enables Consistency
- Scheduled tasks run reliably
- No manual steps during racing day
- Learning happens automatically
