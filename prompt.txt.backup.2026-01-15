=== LEARNED INSIGHTS (Updated 2026-01-15) ===

Based on analysis of last 7 days performance (weekly learning cycle):

• AVOID favorite selections - losing 100% ROI (n=74)
• AVOID mid_price selections - losing 96% ROI (n=143)
• AVOID outsider selections - losing 100% ROI (n=49)
• WIN bet strike rate too low (0%) - need stronger fancies (n=15)
• Each-way place rate too low (3%) - tighten EW criteria (n=29)
• Be cautious at: Newmarket, Ascot, The
• Winning pattern: prioritize enhanced_analysis selections

Apply these learnings when making selections. Continuously adapt strategy based on what works.
