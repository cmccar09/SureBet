=== ODDS SWEET SPOT (MANDATORY FOCUS) ===

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Find WINNERS with odds between 3.0 and 9.0 (2/1 to 8/1)**

This is your CORE MISSION. Every selection should be evaluated against this target.

Historical performance data proves this range is MOST PROFITABLE:
• 3.0-9.0 odds (2/1 to 8/1): 28.6% win rate, 54% ROI - SWEET SPOT ✓
• Under 3.0 odds: Poor value, favorites rarely win for us
• Over 9.0 odds: Inconsistent, too many losses

**SWEET SPOT WINNER PROFILE (Your ideal selection):**
- Odds: 3.0 to 9.0 (decimal) / 2/1 to 8/1 (fractional)
- Recent WINNER in last 3 races (crucial!)
- Solid course/distance experience
- Currently in-form trainer
- Racing at optimal class level (not over/under-matched)
- Good jockey booking

**Why this range makes MONEY:**
- High enough odds for strong returns (3.0 = 200% profit on stake)
- Realistic win probability (not outsiders or no-hopers)
- Horses with genuine winning form, not just placing
- Optimal risk/reward balance proven by our data

**CONFIDENCE BOOSTING for Sweet Spot:**
If a horse is in the 3.0-9.0 range AND has winning form, ADD 15-20 points to base confidence.
If a horse is in the 3.5-6.0 range (ultimate sweet spot), ADD 25 points to base confidence.

**STRICT RULES for picks outside 3.0-9.0:**
- Under 3.0 odds: AVOID unless truly exceptional class + 80%+ win confidence
- 9.0-15.0 odds: Only if recent winner (last 2 races) + clear form advantage
- Over 15.0 odds: NEVER recommend - historically 0% win rate for us

**Daily Selection Priority Order:**
1. FIRST: Find all horses with odds 3.0-9.0 that have WON in last 3 races
2. SECOND: From those, identify best form/trainer/jockey combinations
3. THIRD: Only if insufficient quality picks in range, consider exceptional outsiders
4. TARGET: Minimum 60% of daily picks should be in 3.0-9.0 range

The sweet spot is where WINNERS live. Focus there relentlessly.

=== SELECTION CRITERIA ===

=== CRITICAL LEARNING: Musselburgh 13:55 Loss (2026-02-01) ===

**MISTAKE IDENTIFIED:** Over-weighted course experience, under-weighted VALUE SCORE

Race: Musselburgh 13:55, 5 runners, Good to Soft
✗ Selected: Koukeo (2.2 odds) - LOST
✓ Missed: Pure Carbon (3.25 odds) - WON

**Why We Made the Wrong Choice:**
- Koukeo: Value Score 7/10, Edge 14.4%, Form 9/10, 1 course win
- Pure Carbon: Value Score 9/10, Edge 23.5%, Form 8/10, 0 course wins

We chose the horse with course experience over the horse with SUPERIOR VALUE.

**NEW MANDATORY RULES - EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **VALUE SCORE IS PRIMARY (40% weight)**
   - When comparing horses with similar form (8-9/10), ALWAYS prefer higher value score
   - A 9/10 value horse beats a 7/10 value horse even with course disadvantage
   - Edge percentage difference >8% = value horse MUST be favored

2. **PROGRESSIVE FORM > PERFECT RECENT FORM (30% weight)**
   - Form pattern U-2-1 (improving trajectory) can be STRONGER than 1-1-X (plateau)
   - Look for IMPROVEMENT trend, not just recent wins
   - A horse getting better is more valuable than one maintaining

3. **SMALL FIELD VALUE DYNAMICS (≤5 runners)**
   - Favorites in 5-runner races are often over-bet
   - Give EXTRA weight to value picks at 3-5 odds with value score 8+
   - Course experience is LESS important in small fields

4. **COURSE WINS - HELPFUL NOT DECISIVE (Reduce to 15% weight)**
   - Course wins should NOT override:
     * Superior value score (9 vs 7)
     * Superior edge percentage (>15% difference)
     * Progressive recent form (U-2-1 vs 1-1-X)
   - Good horses adapt to new courses - don't penalize too heavily

**UPDATED DECISION WEIGHTING:**
- Value Score + Edge %: 40% (was 30%)
- Form Score + Trend: 30% (unchanged)
- Class/Course Factors: 30% (was 40%)

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
When multiple horses score 8+ on form, the tiebreaker MUST be value score, not course experience.
