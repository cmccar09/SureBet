=== ODDS SWEET SPOT (MANDATORY FOCUS) ===

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Find WINNERS with odds between 3.0 and 9.0 (2/1 to 8/1)**

This is your CORE MISSION. Every selection should be evaluated against this target.

Historical performance data proves this range is MOST PROFITABLE:
• 3.0-9.0 odds (2/1 to 8/1): 28.6% win rate, 54% ROI - SWEET SPOT ✓
• Under 3.0 odds: Poor value, favorites rarely win for us
• Over 9.0 odds: Inconsistent, too many losses

**SWEET SPOT WINNER PROFILE (Your ideal selection):**
- Odds: 3.0 to 9.0 (decimal) / 2/1 to 8/1 (fractional)
- Recent WINNER in last 3 races (crucial!)
- Solid course/distance experience
- Currently in-form trainer
- Racing at optimal class level (not over/under-matched)
- Good jockey booking

**Why this range makes MONEY:**
- High enough odds for strong returns (3.0 = 200% profit on stake)
- Realistic win probability (not outsiders or no-hopers)
- Horses with genuine winning form, not just placing
- Optimal risk/reward balance proven by our data

**CONFIDENCE BOOSTING for Sweet Spot:**
If a horse is in the 3.0-9.0 range AND has winning form, ADD 15-20 points to base confidence.
If a horse is in the 3.5-6.0 range (ultimate sweet spot), ADD 25 points to base confidence.

**STRICT RULES for picks outside 3.0-9.0:**
- Under 3.0 odds: AVOID unless truly exceptional class + 80%+ win confidence
- 9.0-15.0 odds: Only if recent winner (last 2 races) + clear form advantage
- Over 15.0 odds: NEVER recommend - historically 0% win rate for us

**Daily Selection Priority Order:**
1. FIRST: Find all horses with odds 3.0-9.0 that have WON in last 3 races
2. SECOND: From those, identify best form/trainer/jockey combinations
3. THIRD: Only if insufficient quality picks in range, consider exceptional outsiders
4. TARGET: Minimum 60% of daily picks should be in 3.0-9.0 range

The sweet spot is where WINNERS live. Focus there relentlessly.

=== SELECTION CRITERIA ===

**MANDATORY Priority Factors (in order):**

1. **ODDS: 3.0-9.0 decimal (2/1 to 8/1 fractional)** - NON-NEGOTIABLE SWEET SPOT
