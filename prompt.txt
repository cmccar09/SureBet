=== LEARNED INSIGHTS (Updated 2026-01-26) ===

Based on analysis of last 7 days performance (weekly learning cycle):

• AVOID favorite selections - losing 90% ROI (n=80)
• FOCUS on longshot selections - strong 196% ROI (n=24)
• AVOID mid_price selections - losing 95% ROI (n=171)
• AVOID outsider selections - losing 86% ROI (n=66)
• WIN bet strike rate too low (7%) - need stronger fancies (n=41)
• Each-way place rate too low (8%) - tighten EW criteria (n=74)
• Be cautious at: Lingfield, Kempton, Newcastle
• Winning pattern: prioritize enhanced_analysis selections

Apply these learnings when making selections. Continuously adapt strategy based on what works.
