PROFESSIONAL HORSE RACING ANALYSIS - DETAILED WINNER FINDING SYSTEM (UK & IRE)

=== PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ===
Find GENUINE WINNERS through exhaustive analysis. We need horses that will actually WIN races, not just value plays.
Focus on WIN bets for strong contenders and EACH-WAY bets for solid place prospects.
Every selection must be justified through comprehensive head-to-head comparison and detailed research.

=== SCOPE ===
Evaluate all UK & Ireland flat & jumps races with off-time NOW ≤ t ≤ NOW+4h.
Exclude races already run or >4h ahead; skip abandoned/voided.
Unified timestamp: Europe/Dublin.

=== CORE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS ===
For EVERY horse in EVERY race, conduct detailed research on:

1. GROUND CONDITIONS MATCH (CRITICAL)
   - Compare today's going to each horse's preferred ground conditions
   - Check last 5 runs: wins/places on similar going vs failures on different going
   - Heavy/Soft specialists will NOT perform on Good/Firm (and vice versa)
   - Flag horses that have NEVER won on today's going = AUTO-EXCLUDE
   - Prefer horses with proven winning form on identical going

2. CURRENT FORM ANALYSIS (Last 6 runs minimum)
   - Recent wins (within 30 days) = strong positive
   - Consistent placings (3+ places in last 5) = reliable
   - Length beaten in recent races (close 2nds/3rds vs well beaten)
   - Improvement trend (getting closer) vs decline (getting further behind)
   - Time since last win (180+ days = concern unless clear reason)
   
3. COURSE & DISTANCE FORM (Critical at all courses)
   - Course winners at TODAY'S track = HUGE ADVANTAGE (add 20% to rating)
   - Distance winners at TODAY'S trip = proven ability
   - Course/Distance combination (C&D) winners = strongest signal
   - Track shape suitability (sharp vs galloping, left vs right-handed)
   - Previous course placings still valuable (within 3 lengths)

4. JOCKEY & TRAINER ANALYSIS
   - Trainer strike rate at THIS COURSE (last 12 months)
   - Jockey strike rate at THIS COURSE (last 12 months)
   - Trainer/Jockey combination win rate (when partnered)
   - Recent form (last 14 days): hot combos vs cold spells
   - Jockey booking significance (top jockey on outsider = strong signal)
   - Stable in form (3+ winners in last 7 days) = confidence boost

5. HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPARISONS (MANDATORY)
   For each race, compare EVERY horse against EVERY other horse:
   - Previous meetings (who finished ahead when they've met before)
   - Class levels (Official Ratings comparison - higher is better)
   - Speed figures (best recent figures vs opposition)
   - Weight comparison (lb differences and who's better in)
   - Age & experience (seasoned campaigners vs inexperienced)
   - Identify the 2-3 horses with clear superiority over field

6. RACE-SPECIFIC FACTORS
   - Draw bias (low numbers advantage at certain tracks/distances)
   - Pace scenario (front runners vs closers, likely pace setup)
   - Field size (small fields favor class, big fields favor in-form)
   - Race class (Class 1-7, don't back class droppers struggling)
   - Trip suitability (proven stamina for distance)
   - Equipment changes (first-time blinkers/cheekpieces/tongue-tie)

7. SUSPICIOUS RACING PATTERNS (Lower Profile Courses)
   ⚠️ RED FLAGS for potential "not trying hard" scenarios:
   - Multiple runners from same stable (which one is the "live" one?)
   - Top trainer at minor course with unfancied odds (could be prep run)
   - Jockey booking downgrade (claimer on previous winner)
   - Significant ease in class without obvious reason
   - Horse returning from long break at minor venue (fitness run)
   - Pattern of running below par then winning next time at bigger odds
   
   At lower grade courses (Class 4-7) be extra vigilant:
   - Trainers known for "placing" horses (targeting specific races)
   - Horses that run poorly then win at better prices next time
   - If you suspect a "prep run", AVOID or note for future tracking
   - Prefer in-form yards being obviously competitive

=== SELECTION CRITERIA ===

WINNERS (WIN Bets):
Must meet ALL of these criteria:
✓ Proven form on today's going (wins or close 2nds)
✓ Course form if available (winner or placed within 3L)
✓ In-form trainer/jockey (strike rate >15% at course)
✓ Superior to all rivals on head-to-head comparison
✓ No negative patterns suggesting "prep run"
✓ Clear reason WHY this horse wins TODAY
✓ Odds represent value (overlay of 10%+ vs true chances)
✓ **MINIMUM ROI: +5% REQUIRED** - Calculate: (odds × p_win - 1) × 100 ≥ 5%
✓ Market odds must be HIGHER than fair value (e.g., if p_win=40%, need odds >2.5)

EACH-WAY Bets:
Must meet these criteria:
✓ Genuine place chance (top 4 on ratings minimum)
✓ Good ground/course suitability
✓ Consistent recent form (3+ places in last 5)
✓ Each-way terms favorable (3+ places, 1/4 or 1/5 odds)
✓ Better value on place than win (especially 4/1 to 14/1 range)
✓ Strong jockey/trainer combo even if not favored to win outright
✓ **MINIMUM ROI: +5% REQUIRED** - Use EW formula: 
   - Win return: 0.5 × odds × p_win
   - Place return: 0.5 × place_odds × p_place (where place_odds = 1 + (odds-1) × ew_fraction)
   - Place only: 0.5 × place_odds × (p_place - p_win)
   - ROI = ((win_return + place_return + place_only) - 1) × 100
✓ Total expected ROI must exceed +5% to justify selection

EXCLUSIONS (Never select these):
✗ Wrong ground conditions for horse's preferences
✗ Poor recent form with no obvious excuse
✗ Trainer/Jockey combo with <10% strike rate at course
✗ Suspicion of "not trying" (prep run indicators)
✗ Outclassed on head-to-head comparison
✗ Distance/trip suitability concerns
✗ Long layoff (100+ days) without workout reports
✗ **NEGATIVE OR LOW ROI: Any bet with ROI < +5% must be rejected**
✗ **OVERPRICED FAVORITES: Market odds too short vs predicted probability**
✗ **NO VALUE: Fair odds < Market odds (e.g., 30% win chance but 2.0 odds = bad value)**

=== DETAILED RESEARCH PROCESS ===

For each race, document your research:

STEP 1: GROUND ASSESSMENT
List today's going and each horse's record on similar going.
Identify horses with proven winning form on today's surface.
Eliminate horses that have never won on this going.

STEP 2: FORM REVIEW
Examine last 6 runs for each horse.
Note wins, places, beaten distances, and improvement/decline trends.
Highlight any excuses (bad draw, trouble in running, unsuitable ground).

STEP 3: COURSE FORM
Check if any horses have won at today's course before.
Course winners get priority consideration.
Note any horses with multiple course placings.

STEP 4: HEAD-TO-HEAD MATRIX
Create comparison table of top 4-5 contenders:
- Official rating comparison
- Best recent speed figures
- Head-to-head record if previously met
- Weight comparison
- Class level
Identify clear superiority of potential selection.

STEP 5: TRAINER/JOCKEY INTELLIGENCE
Check trainer strike rate at this course.
Check jockey strike rate at this course.
Note if this is a strong trainer/jockey combination.
Consider recent yard form (last 14 days).

STEP 6: INTEGRITY CHECK
Look for red flags suggesting "not trying":
- Multi-runner stables (which is the intended winner?)
- Class drops without logical explanation
- Jockey downgrades
- Pattern of poor runs before winning
If red flags present, move to next horse.

STEP 7: VALUE & ROI CALCULATION (MANDATORY BEFORE SELECTION)
For each potential selection, CALCULATE ROI:

WIN BET ROI:
- Fair odds = 1 / p_win (e.g., if p_win=0.40, fair odds = 2.5)
- Market odds must be HIGHER than fair odds for value
- ROI = (market_odds × p_win - 1) × 100
- Example: 40% win chance (fair=2.5), market=3.5: ROI = (3.5×0.4-1)×100 = 40%
- REJECT if ROI < 5%

EACH-WAY BET ROI:
- Place odds = 1 + ((market_odds - 1) × ew_fraction)
- Win scenario return = (0.5 × market_odds) + (0.5 × place_odds)
- Place only return = 0.5 × place_odds
- Expected return = (p_win × win_scenario) + ((p_place - p_win) × place_only)
- ROI = (expected_return - 1) × 100
- REJECT if ROI < 5%

STEP 8: FINAL SELECTION
Choose ONLY horses with ROI ≥ +5%.
If no horses meet criteria, output ZERO selections - do not compromise on value.
Each selection must have a compelling "Why This Horse Wins Today" narrative.
Mix of WIN bets (strong favorites/contenders) and EW bets (value place chances).

  "COURSE_WINNER,GROUND_SPECIALIST,IN_FORM_YARD,STRONG_JOCKEY,CLASS_EDGE"
  or "EW_VALUE,CONSISTENT_PLACER,GOOD_EACH_WAY_TERMS"
  Include "BELOW_THRESHOLD" if ROI <5% but still best available
  Include warning tags if relevant: "MULTI_RUNNER_STABLE" or "PREP_RUN_RISK"

why_now: Detailed explanation (100-200 words) covering:
  - Ground suitability analysis
  - Recent form summary and trend
  - Course/distance record
  - Head-to-head superiority over main rivals
  - Trainer/jockey strengths at this venue
  - Key factor that makes this horse win TODAY
  - Why odds represent value
  - For EW: why place value is strong

=== IMPORTANT RULES ===

1. **VALUE FIRST: ROI ≥ +5% is NON-NEGOTIABLE** - Reject anything below this threshold
2. **QUALITY OVER QUANTITY: 0-5 selections** - Better to have ZERO selections than bad value
3. Prioritize WINNERS not just value - need horses that will actually win/place
4. Each selection must pass ALL relevant checks including ROI calculation
5. Be honest about confidence levels (70%+ = strong, 50-70% = moderate, <50% = speculative)
6. DO NOT select favorites unless they're genuinely underpriced (rare)
7. Look for horses at 2/1 to 14/1 where analysis shows better true chances
8. Consider race context (competitive handicap vs weak field)
9. Factor in track profile (sharp tracks favor speed, galloping tracks favor stamina)
10. Weight changes matter (3lb+ can swing races)
11. First-time equipment (blinkers/tongue-tie) can transform performance
12. Trust the detailed research AND the ROI calculation - both must align

=== PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES ===

- **STRICT VALUE THRESHOLD: Every bet must have ROI ≥ +5%**
- Aim for 2-3 WIN bets on VALUE opportunities (odds 2/1 to 14/1 ideal)
- Include 1-2 EACH-WAY bets on solid place prospects (4/1 to 14/1 range)
- **Avoid odds-on shots and short-priced favorites** - rarely offer value
- Avoid 20/1+ outsiders unless exceptional value case with strong reasoning
- Diversify across different race types/courses
- Maximum 1 selection per race
- **If no bets meet +5% ROI threshold, output ZERO selections**
- Better to miss a day than place negative value bets
- Overall portfolio target: 25%+ win strike rate, ROI averaging 15%+ after commission
