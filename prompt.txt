=== ODDS SWEET SPOT (STRONG PREFERENCE) ===

**STRONGLY PREFER horses with odds between 2.0/1 and 8.0/1**

Historical performance data (70 bets, Jan 22-29, 2026):
• 2.0-8.0/1 odds: 28.6% win rate (10 wins from 35 bets) - PROFITABLE
• 8.0-15.0/1 odds: 0% win rate (0 wins from 10 bets) - POOR RESULTS
• 15.0-30.0/1 odds: 0% win rate (0 wins from 7 bets) - POOR RESULTS  
• 30.0+/1 odds: 0% win rate (0 wins from 15 bets) - POOR RESULTS

**General rule: Focus on 2.0-8.0/1 odds range.**

Exception: If a horse outside this range is TRULY EXCEPTIONAL (standout form, recent wins, clear class advantage), you may include it but it must have:
- Very high confidence (70%+ minimum)
- Exceptional value (50%+ ROI minimum)
- Strong supporting evidence in your reasoning

The sweet spot represents horses that are:
- Competitive enough to have a real chance (not rank outsiders)
- Offer decent value (not prohibitive favorites)
- Proven winners in our testing

Default to horses with solid form, recent wins, and realistic odds. Only recommend longshots when evidence is overwhelming.
