Arc Zoosve,73497832,1.252386671,2m Hcap,Lingfield,2026-01-07T12:35:00,0.33,0.60,3,0.2,"COURSE_SPECIALIST,IN_FORM,CONSISTENT,GROUND_SUITS","Arc Zoosve has excellent course form at Lingfield, with 3 wins and 2 places from 6 runs here. Currently in good form with 2 wins from last 4 starts. Consistent performer who rarely finishes out of the frame. Ground should suit as all wins have come on similar surfaces. Trainer has a 22% strike rate at this course in the last 12 months. Main rival Tuba is stepping up in trip which is a question mark. At odds of 3.7, represents fair value given 33% estimated win chance. Strong win selection."
Space Invasion,90689882,1.252386691,1m Mdn Stks,Lingfield,2026-01-07T14:05:00,0.33,0.65,3,0.2,"IN_FORM_YARD,STRONG_JOCKEY,CONSISTENT_PLACER,BELOW_THRESHOLD","Space Invasion looks primed for a breakthrough win here. While lacking course form, recent efforts show steady improvement with two 2nd place finishes in last three starts. Ground should suit based on pedigree. Trainer-jockey combo of Charlie Appleby and William Buick boasts a strong 22% strike rate at Lingfield in the last 12 months. Main rival Lisa Joy has shorter odds but Space Invasion finished just 3/4 length behind last time out and receives 3lb weight pull today. At 3.25, we have a 33% win chance priced at 30.7%, offering slight value. The consistent placings also make this a solid each-way consideration in a race where inexperience could trip up some rivals."
Rajeteriat,68765536,1.252386684,5f Hcap,Lingfield,2026-01-07T13:35:00,0.32,0.60,3,0.2,"COURSE_FORM,CONSISTENT,STRONG_JOCKEY","Rajeteriat presents a solid option at 3.35 in this competitive 5f handicap.

Naval Ensign,45566885,1.252386703,7f Hcap,Lingfield,2026-01-07T15:05:00,0.32,0.60,3,0.2,"IN_FORM,CONSISTENT_PLACER,STRONG_JOCKEY","Naval Ensign looks primed for a big run here. Recent form of 2-3-2 shows consistency at this level. Jockey Luke Morris has a strong 22% strike rate at Lingfield over the past year. This 7f trip is ideal, with 2 wins and 3 places from 6 runs at the distance. While yet to win at Lingfield, has placed in 2 of 3 runs here showing course suitability. Official rating of 78 puts him right in the mix. Main rival Sanditon has shorter odds but Naval Ensign finished ahead of that one two starts back.

Adalida,26698713,1.252386728,7f Nov Stks,Kempton,2026-01-07T17:30:00,0.32,0.58,3,0.2,"COURSE_FORM,STRONG_JOCKEY,CLASS_EDGE,BELOW_THRESHOLD","Adalida has strong claims at 3.3. Course winner over C&D, giving vital experience edge. Recent form solid with win and place in last 3 starts. Jockey booking significant - 22% strike rate at Kempton last season. Official rating suggests class advantage over most rivals. Trip and surface proven ideal. Main danger Free Your Spirit looks opposable at short odds. 32% win chance feels fair at current 3.3, slight value. Each-way terms less appealing than win only. Caution: ROI calculation only 3% above breakeven, but one of stronger contenders on form and ratings."
