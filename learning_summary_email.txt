CRITICAL PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

1. Going Conditions = Game Changer
   - Heavy going: Form patterns don't apply
   - Normal going: Form + class + value are primary
   
2. Race Type Differentiation
   - Large handicaps: Outsider value opportunities
   - Small graded races: Favorites dominate

3. Value Discipline Working
   - Correctly avoided 4/9 favorite despite it winning
   - Focus on long-term profitability

9 NEW RULES IMPLEMENTED
1. NEVER bet if edge_percentage < 0%
2. Reject if confidence < 30%
3. Reject if combined_score < 20/30
4. Course winners: +25 points (was +15)
5. Perfect going: +15, good going: +5
6. Class context: wins in same/higher class only
7. Improving trend > hot streak from lower class
