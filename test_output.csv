Clay Pigeons,82718828,1.251686491,1m7f NHF,Catterick,2025-12-16T15:20:00Z,0.58,0.82,3,0.2,BELOW_THRESHOLD|market-confirmed|short-favorite,Heavily backed favorite in novice hurdle debut context; price compression (1.93 implies 52% but calibrated model 58%) offers modest +11% overlay; low fragility but EW terms poor (1/5 three places) makes win-only appropriate; dominant market signal suggests stable support
Landsborough,85189621,1.251686491,1m7f NHF,Catterick,2025-12-16T15:20:00Z,0.19,0.48,3,0.2,BELOW_THRESHOLD|ew-value|pace-potential,Second choice at 6.0 (17% implied vs 19% model) shows +12% overlay; strong place probability (48%) makes EW viable despite modest terms; likely pace presser in small field could exploit if favorite falters; moderate fragility but liquidity adequate
Diamond White,13331370,1.251686491,1m7f NHF,Catterick,2025-12-16T15:20:00Z,0.12,0.38,3,0.2,BELOW_THRESHOLD|ew-value|class-uncertainty,Third in betting at 7.6 (13% implied vs 12% model) shows marginal value; place probability 38% supports EW angle in 7-runner field with three places paid; potential closer profile in small field but higher fragility due to limited form exposure
I C U In My Dreams,91172240,1.251686491,1m7f NHF,Catterick,2025-12-16T15:20:00Z,0.08,0.28,3,0.2,BELOW_THRESHOLD|longshot-place-value|fragile,Priced 9.0 (11% implied vs 8% model) shows underlay on win but 28% place probability creates marginal EW interest; small field dynamics and potential pace collapse scenario; high fragility and limited recent form caps confidence but represents portfolio diversification at longer odds
Let It Settle,86669112,1.251686491,1m7f NHF,Catterick,2025-12-16T15:20:00Z,0.05,0.18,3,0.2,BELOW_THRESHOLD|outsider-speculative|fragile,Priced 13.5 (7% implied vs 5% model) represents speculative underlay; 18% place model suggests minimal EW value; included for completion but weak fundamental case in small novice hurdle field; high uncertainty and poor liquidity make pass recommendation despite longer-odds portfolio diversification mandate
