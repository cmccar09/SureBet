## Performance by Edge Type


## Recommended Adjustments

1. MEDIUM_PRIORITY: Win rate 10.0% is significantly below expected 21.3%. Consider tightening overlay threshold or increasing min_back price filter.

2. MEDIUM_PRIORITY: Low strike rate suggests overlay threshold may need increase. Current: ≥10%. Consider testing ≥15% or ≥20%.
