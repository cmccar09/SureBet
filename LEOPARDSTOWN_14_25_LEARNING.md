## PRE-RACE ANALYSIS vs ACTUAL RESULT

### WINNER: Saint Le Fort
- **Pre-race odds:** 13.0
- **Starting price:** 10/1 (11.0)
- **Form:** 598453 (5th, 9th, 8th, 4th, 5th, 3rd)
- **LTO:** 5th place (NOT a winner)
- **Win in last 3:** NO
- **Recent wins:** 0 in recent form
- **Odds category:** OUTSIDER (9-15 range)

### WOULD WE HAVE PICKED THE WINNER?
**NO ✗**

**Reason for rejection:** No recent win in form

---

## CRITICAL PATTERNS OBSERVED

### Pattern 1: No Recent Win Required
- **Saint Le Fort** won despite:
  - Last run: 5th place
  - No win in last 3 runs
  - No win in last 6 runs shown (598453)
  
- This contradicts our "recent winner" preference
- **Heavy going** may have been the key factor - different horses handle heavy ground

### Pattern 2: Odds Sweet Spot Validation
- Winner @ 13.0 pre-race = OUTSIDER category (9-15)
- NOT in our preferred 3-9 "sweet spot"
- But close to sweet spot upper bound

### Pattern 3: Form Context on Heavy
- Form string 598453 shows inconsistent form
- But on **Heavy ground**, form may not translate
- Going-specific form is critical (we don't have going-specific historical form yet)

### Pattern 4: Top 5 Analysis
1. **Saint Le Fort** (1st) - 13.0 odds, no recent wins
2. **Savante** (2nd) - 32.0 odds, LONGSHOT, no recent wins  
3. **He Can't Dance** (3rd) - 12.0 odds, NOT IN OUR ANALYSIS (missing horse?)
4. **Barra Rua** (4th) - 19.5 odds, no recent wins
5. **Dippedinmoonlight** (5th) - 10.5 odds, no recent wins

**None of the top 5 were recent winners!**

### Pattern 5: Favorites Failed
- County Final (5.6) - DNP
- Son Of Anarchy (7.6) - DNP
- Champagne Kid (10.0) - DNP

All three shortest-priced horses failed to place.

## KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. HEAVY GOING CHANGES EVERYTHING
- Heavy going is an EXTREME condition
- Normal form patterns may not apply
- Horses that handle heavy ground have massive advantage
- **Need going-specific form analysis**

### 2. RECENT WIN RULE TOO STRICT
- Current rule: Prefer horses with recent wins
- Reality: Saint Le Fort won with 598453 form (no wins shown)
- **Adjustment:** On heavy/soft going, prioritize going match over recent form

### 3. FAVORITES STRUGGLE ON HEAVY
- Top 3 in betting all failed
- Market may not price heavy going ability correctly
- **Opportunity:** Heavy ground races = value in outsiders who handle conditions

### 4. MISSING HORSE DATA
- "He Can't Dance" (3rd place) not in our analysis
- Finished 3rd @ 7/1
- **Issue:** Data collection incomplete or horse added late?

### 5. LONGSHOT PLACED 2ND
- Savante @ 32.0 (18/1 SP) finished 2nd
- Form: 8P-0557 (terrible recent form)
- But handled heavy going when others couldn't

---

## RECOMMENDED UPDATES

### IMMEDIATE:
1. **Add going-specific form scoring:**
   - If going = Heavy/Soft → prioritize going match over raw form
   - Horses with proven heavy ground form get +30 points
   - Devalue recent wins on Good/Firm when going is Heavy

2. **Relax recent win requirement on extreme going:**
   - Heavy/Soft going: Don't require recent win
   - Good/Firm going: Keep recent win preference

3. **Heavy going = outsider value:**
   - When going = Heavy, expand sweet spot to 3-15
   - Market often misprices heavy ground ability

### MEDIUM TERM:
4. **Build going-specific database:**
   - Track which horses have won on Heavy/Soft before
   - Create "proven heavy ground performer" flag
   - Worth +40 points on matching going

5. **Investigate missing horses:**
   - Why was "He Can't Dance" not analyzed?
   - Ensure complete data capture

## COMPARISON TO KEMPTON LEARNING

### Kempton 13:27 (Good Going):
- Winner: Aviation @ 5/1
- Had improving form, course win, perfect going match
- **Recent form mattered** on Good going

### Leopardstown 14:25 (Heavy Going):
- Winner: Saint Le Fort @ 10/1  
- Poor recent form (598453)
- **Going ability trumped form** on Heavy

### Insight:
**Different going conditions require different selection criteria**
- Good/Firm = form + class + value
- Heavy/Soft = going ability + stamina > form

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✓ Save learning to database (DONE)
2. Wait for more Heavy going races to validate pattern
3. Track other Leopardstown races today for going impact
4. Build going-specific weighting into prompt.txt
5. Continue 2-week learning to gather more data points
